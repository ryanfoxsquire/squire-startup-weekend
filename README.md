Original ReadMe:

This repository contains the code examples for the Python Flask workshop. Each section has it's own Flask app in their own separate directories.

You'll need Python 2.7 and Flask installed.

You can see the final Flask demo running on Heroku here: http://python-flask-code.herokuapp.com/
